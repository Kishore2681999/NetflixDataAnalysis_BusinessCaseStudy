Handle Missing Values:
For categorical columns, missing values were replaced with "Unknown".
For continuous columns, missing values were replaced with 0.


Analysis and Insights:


Basic Analysis

Categorical Variable Counts: Value counts for each category in categorical columns were calculated and visualized using bar plots.
Visualization: Count plots were generated for each categorical variable to show their distribution.

TV Shows vs. Movies
